Database
========

There are several files that are used in interfacing with the database
powering this application. Some, like `models.py` and `admin.py`, are standard
parts of any Django application. Others, like `modelTemplates.py`, are not
standard, but nonetheless directly database related (which is why they are
categorized here, not under Functions)
